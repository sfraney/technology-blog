I pick up and put down a bunch of projects.  Sometimes I actually finish them and sometimes I even use them for a while.  At the time, I never really know which bucket any given project will fit into so I don't take a lot of notes.  Usually I just have a collection of bookmarks.  This means that those long-lived projects, or even ones that didn't get so far, will have some bit of knowledge that I synthesized or cobbled together from a bunch of different sources and it's nearly impossible to reconstruct them perhaps years down the road.

In many cases, this is a good thing because a) it strengthens knowledge to re-learn it and b) technology changes and what was good and useful in the past might not be the best solution today (or even an advisable solution given vulnerabilities or exploitation that can happen over time).  However, in some cases, I just need to get that thing I rely on back up-and-running.  This blog will hopefully collect all that need-to-know information and a bunch of less useful stuff so I can limit downtime and kickstart relearning in the future.
